*Salt of Epsom* was made in 48 hours for the [Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/), at the Melbourne site. During that time we formed teams, came up with an idea, and built the game. Doing a game jam in person and with a team with varied talents was so much fun. Check out the game [here](https://thisisrob.itch.io/salt-of-epsom).

## The Team

I ended up on a team of 7; 3 programmers, 1 artist, 1 audio, 1 producer/artist, and 1 designer/writer.

## The Theme

The theme for the jam was *Bubbles*. We spent a while during team formation coming up with ideas and then split into teams based on what idea each us felt most interested in or capable of pull off. Our team decided to make a cozy game where you play as a witch brewing and testing bath bombs.

## Building the game

We split the programming tasks into 3 parts; making the bath bombs, testing the bath bombs, and UI and I took the task of making the bath bombs. This involved creating items with various attributes, allowing th player to pick up, drop, and mix the items, and combining the items into bath bombs. As the game jam progressed we move to adding adding in the assets from the rest of our team and bug hunting.

## Future of the game

There is a show case in March so we are planing on squashing the remaining bugs and possibly adding a quest system to add a goal to the game.
