This was an in-person 48 hour game jam. During that time we formed teams, came up with an idea, and built the game. Doing a game jam in person and with a team with varied talents was so much fun. Check out the game [here](https://thisisrob.itch.io/salt-of-epsom).

## The Team

I ended up on a team of 7; 3 programmers, 1 artist, 1 audio, 1 producer/artist, and 1 designer/writer.

## The Theme

The theme for the jam was *Bubbles*. We spent a while during team formation coming up with ideas and then split into teams based on what idea each us felt most interested in or capable of pull off. Our team decided to make a cozy game where you play as a witch brewing and testing bath bombs.
