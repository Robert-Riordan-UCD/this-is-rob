I had an old pannier and a new bike that didn't have a suitable mounting point for it, so I made an adaptor to hold it. I split the model into 2 parts and printed it on it's ends so that the layer lines wouldn't align with weight of the bag. The parts are joined with a plate with pegs, which I then used a soldering iron to weld all the parts together.
