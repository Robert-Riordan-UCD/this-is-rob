This is a simple screenshot tool to capture images while you are making your game. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Robert-Riordan-UCD/godot-screenshot).

I mostly made this to learn how addons work in a very simple scenario, inspired by [this 90 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVutnQ0odo), where *The Shaggy Dev* creates very a simple autoload script to take screenshots.

It only took about an hour to go from watching the video to implementing it into an addon. Most of the time was spent learning how addons work and then polishing it up to make the addon experience as seamless as possible.
