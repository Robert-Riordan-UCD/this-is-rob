I designed the layout using keyboard-layout-editor.com and lasercut each of them to get a feel for the ergonomics of the keyboard before committing to the PCB design.

# Version 1
I felt there wasn't enough stagger on the pinky column and the thumb cluster felt too far away from the rest of the keyboard.

# Version 2
The pinky felt better now but it could still move down slightly further. The thumb cluster felt better also, but just a bit to low.
