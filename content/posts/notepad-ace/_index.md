*Notepad Ace* is a 2D speedrunning platformer, that I made over the course of a month for [GitHub Game Off 2024](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024).

You can play *Notepad Ace* [here](https://thisisrob.itch.io/notepad-ace) or checkout the source [here](https://github.com/Robert-Riordan-UCD/GitHubGameOff2024).

My goal with this project was to go through the complete game development cycle within a deadline. The theme of the game jam was *secrets*, so I based my game around hidden mechanics which could be used to access short cuts to get faster times.

I made everything for this game by myself, except for the leaderboard server. I didn't want to be responsible for maintaining a server for a quick project long term, so I used [Silent Wolf](https://silentwolf.com/) to host the leaderboard. It's a free service so I don;t expect it to last forever, but it's already more reliable than if I had setup the server myself during the jam.

# Secrets

The game can be beaten without using any of the secret mechanics. However, there are 3 secret mechanics; wall jump, dash, and invert, each of which can be used to access a new shortcut.

The controls for each mechanic are hidden in the background art around the stage. I tried to make them reasonably obvious given that this was a game jam and I can only expect a player to spend 2 or 3 minutes with my game.
