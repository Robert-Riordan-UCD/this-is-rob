I made this site to keep track of all my projects that I have finished.

It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [Lightbi](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/lightbi-hugo/) theme. I have made a number of modifications to the theme.

## Modifications

1. Post previews render in a nestled grid style instead of a perfectly linear one by using [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/).

2. Only post categories show up on the home page, instead of all posts.

3. Added backward navigation to return to parent posts.

4. Modified the style of the post preview cards.
